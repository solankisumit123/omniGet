    /// Returns a writable directory for large, regenerable, versionable caches

    /// data like settings, notes, presets).
    ///
    /// Intended for: CommunityDragon hash tables, downloaded CDN assets, ML model
    /// caches, snapshots of expensive external APIs — anything sized in MB/GB that
    /// the plugin can always re-fetch if deleted.
    ///
    /// Do NOT use for: user settings (use `save_settings`), personal data
    /// (use `plugin_data_dir`), artifacts the user should see in their file
    /// manager (use `default_output_dir`).
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `plugin_id`: the caller plugin's id. Host uses this to scope caches
    ///   per-plugin so different plugins never collide.
    /// - `namespace`: an arbitrary plugin-controlled string used to partition
    ///   multiple caches inside the same plugin (e.g. `"lol-hashes"`,
    ///   `"cdragon-assets"`, `"patch-14-23"`). Typical shape is
    ///   `"{domain}-{version}"` so the plugin can purge old versions by
    ///   dropping one subdir.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// The full `PathBuf` to the directory. Unlike `plugin_data_dir` (which
    /// returns a path without creating it), this method guarantees the
    /// directory exists and is writable before returning — callers can write
    /// immediately without a separate `create_dir_all` step.
    ///
    /// # Platform layout
    ///
    /// - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wtf.tonho.omniget\external-cache\{plugin_id}\{namespace}\`
    /// - Linux: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/wtf.tonho.omniget/external-cache/{plugin_id}/{namespace}/` (falls back to `~/.cache/...`)
    /// - macOS: `~/Library/Caches/wtf.tonho.omniget/external-cache/{plugin_id}/{namespace}/`
    ///
    /// These are the OS-canonical cache locations (non-roaming on Windows,
    /// `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` on Linux, `Caches/` on macOS). They are deliberately
    /// separate from `plugin_data_dir`, which lives under the roaming /
    /// data directory and is expected to be backed up.
    ///
    /// # Lifecycle
    ///
    /// The host never cleans or expires these directories automatically. The
    /// plugin owns its own retention policy — bump the namespace string when
    /// the underlying data version changes and purge the old subdir when
    /// appropriate.
    ///
    /// # Capability declaration
    ///
    /// Plugins that use this method should declare `"core:external-data-cache"`
    /// in their `plugin.json` `capabilities` array for marketplace transparency.
    /// Note: capability declarations are currently informational — the host
    /// surfaces them to the user in the marketplace UI but does NOT enforce
    /// them at runtime for any SDK method. A future host revision may
    /// introduce uniform runtime enforcement for all capabilities at once.

    /// any HTTP client that accepts Mozilla cookie jars.

    /// Returns `None` when:
    /// * the host does not yet support per-domain cookie storage (older host
    ///   versions running plugins compiled against a newer SDK — the default
    ///   impl below covers them by returning `None`),
    /// * the host has no cookies recorded for this domain,

    /// Plugins should treat `None` as "no cookies for this domain" and fall

    ///   same `youtube.com` bucket.

    ///   the bucket's `_default` account, which is what plugins should use
    ///   unless they expose multi-account UX themselves.
